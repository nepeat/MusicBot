# RhinoBot: The music bot for Discord.

MusicBot is a Discord music bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It plays requested songs and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs.

####This is a horrible fork that is designed to run in a specific meme server and Docker only
#### Don't even bother installing this on your own server as this would have zero support by anyone.
